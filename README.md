Neuronova is not another LLM project.
Its long-term goal is to go beyond current large language models by building a neuro-cognitive mathematical framework capable of representing meaning, scenes, operators, and linguistic structure with far greater interpretability and efficiency.

This prototype is part of a broader plan to develop a next-generation AI architecture, moving away from massive statistical black boxes and toward a system grounded in cognition, geometry and structured semantic dynamics.

I am currently exploring the creation of a startup around this idea.
If you are a:

AI researcher

machine learning engineer

mathematician

cognitive scientist

investor interested in foundational models

…I would be happy to connect.

This repository represents only a small, safe demonstration.
The full kernel and architecture are being developed privately with the intention to form a core team and seek early-stage funding.
